<p>I will be using <strong>Python 3.11 </strong>throughout this course. <br><br>If you are using an any version that comes before Python 3.11, you might notice that some imports will not exist, or that some type annotations won't work with your code. I will do my best to address the workarounds for other Python versions, but just keep in mind that if you get an error in your code, it's very likely that you're using another Python version.<br><br>But with that being said, I hope you enjoy the course!</p>
