# My Python Type Hinting Practice Repository

This repository contains code and examples demonstrating my practice and understanding of Python type hinting.

## Introduction

Python Type Hinting is a feature introduced in Python 3.5 that allows developers to specify the expected types of variables, function arguments, and return values. It helps in making code more readable, and maintainable, and can catch type-related errors early during development.

## Practice Examples

In this repository, you'll find:

- **Examples**: Various Python scripts and modules showcasing the implementation of type hints in different scenarios.
- **Explanatory Notes**: Documentation and comments explaining the usage and benefits of type hinting in Python.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

Replace `(https://github.com/khosrogh/type_annotations_python)` with the URL of this repository.

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

3. Explore the code examples in your preferred Python environment or editor.
